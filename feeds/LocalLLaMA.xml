    <title>Is Nvidia Becoming a Bottleneck for AI Advancement?</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this this morning and wondering if Nvidia might be a bottleneck on AI advancement which led to me reading about recent developments and debates around AI and gpu hardware—and with Nvidia being at the center of it all. Given its dominant role in powering both the training and inference of AI models, I’m curious about whether Nvidia’s current position might actually be holding back AI progress in some ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are a few points that have caught my attention:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Constraints:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recent reports indicate that there are serious concerns about the supply of Nvidia’s AI chips. For example, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager recently warned about a “huge bottleneck” in Nvidia’s chip supply, suggesting that shortages might slow down the rollout of AI technologies across industries 0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There’s also discussion around the “scaling law” in AI. Nvidia’s GPUs have been the workhorse behind the rapid advances in large language models and other AI systems. However, as models get larger and inference demands increase, some argue that relying heavily on Nvidia’s architecture (even with innovations like the Blackwell and Hopper series) might hit physical and economic limits. The Financial Times recently discussed how these scaling challenges might be a limiting factor, implying that more chips (and perhaps different chip architectures) will be needed to sustain AI progress 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerging Alternatives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the flip side, a number of new players—like Cerebras, Groq, and even competitors from AMD and Intel—are developing specialized hardware for AI inference. These alternatives could potentially ease the pressure on Nvidia if they prove to be more efficient or cost-effective for certain tasks. This makes me wonder: Is the industry’s heavy reliance on Nvidia’s GPUs really sustainable in the long run, or will these emerging solutions shift the balance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all this, I’m trying to figure out: - Are Nvidia’s supply and architectural limitations currently acting as a bottleneck to further AI innovation?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Or is the situation more about a temporary growing pain in a rapidly evolving market, where Nvidia’s advancements (and their ability to innovate continuously) will keep pace with demand?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your thoughts &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/TheArchivist314"&gt; /u/TheArchivist314 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilfhyl/is_nvidia_becoming_a_bottleneck_for_ai_advancement/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilfhyl/is_nvidia_becoming_a_bottleneck_for_ai_advancement/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>My experience trying out coding agents -- Qwen2.5-coder-tools/Sonnet 3.5 on Cline and Github Copilot agent mode</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, here's the Qwen2.5 model I've been testing out: &lt;a href="https://ollama.com/hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:14b"&gt;https://ollama.com/hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:14b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd like to just make a few quick notes about my experience over the past few days trying out the preview copilot agent feature against cline using both a specialized version of Qwen2.5 through Cline and the Sonnet 3.5 (copilot API) through Cline and copilot:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start, the bad things:&lt;br /&gt; - Qwen 2.5 coder-tools still seems to run very slowly on my 7900xt, as even though it shouldnt push over the VRAM limit on its own, I'm also running the monitor and IDE on my machine and it kinda runs through the rest. A Q6 quant could be helpful here to get me just a bit extra VRAM.&lt;br /&gt; - Sonnet 3.5 (from copilot API) appears to have the same issues that Sonnet had with my pro chat subscription before -- it's almost like there are two different versions of it that I have access to at different times -- one that is really good at following rules and one that has a 50/50 chance of doing so. Direct access to the API might remedy this but it's expensive, so I'd rather not do that.&lt;br /&gt; - Cline just seems to be really bad at figuring out when it should continue or stop, whichever model I choose and whatever instructions I give it. In comparison to using sonnet pro chat directly with javascript, I've just repeatedly felt like I can trust it to run on its own, and some of the interfaces are so buggy that they're not reliable, such as the history/checkpoints interface. The really irritating thing is that in a controlled environment, Cline should be able to continue until it reaches a solution -- but it never keeps the exit conditions in memory, and thus says it &amp;quot;completed the task&amp;quot; after completing a piece of the task (usually not correctly)&lt;br /&gt; - Both Cline and Copilot are &lt;strong&gt;terrible at atypical environments.&lt;/strong&gt; I can fully define the quirks of the unique environment that the tools are running in -- such as with ROCM vs. CUDA or a heavily restricted Docker Engine, but both are unable to keep this information whithin the model's context -- since the model will break out of it -- such as recommending changing the base image to a CUDA image for a docker container that's meant for ROCM, or getting stuck in a circle of trying the same debugging/fix steps over and over if the problem isn't one that has been solved online before (to be fair, I had difficulty solving this problem directly as well and it was with dev container instances in vscode with the crippled docker engine)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonna be honest, not too many good things, but they show some room for growth:&lt;br /&gt; - Qwen 2.5 can do very simple tasks without using up my rate limits and seems to be really good at using tools at this point -- reaching near the tool-use of error rate of Sonnet 3.5 in my short sessions with it. A slight quant to reduce size and speed things up (without losing this efficacy) would make it my go-to if I could solve the exit-condition problem of Cline (and possibly even spawn multiple Cline agents or have them work under a super-agent).&lt;br /&gt; - Sonnet 3.5 agents can manage complex tasks &lt;strong&gt;as long as they match existing patterns and expectations perfectly --&lt;/strong&gt; otherwise it just requires me to spend more time in agent mode than I would with the chat on the side and autocomplete in the editor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, this agent coding thing really is showing me that Software Engineers aren't gonna be out of a job any time soon, and in fact that the current uses for even the most powerful existing coding agents (Sonnet 3.5 + agent frameworks) do not mesh well with the actual proprietariness and limitations of academic/work systems that require accomodations and use irregular architectures. It appears that getting agents to perform really well at the standard/average coding tasks and environments makes them perform extrodinarily poorly in irregular/real-world hard engineering tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Out of this, I have a few questions for the further development of these kinds of systems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Am I just using Cline wrong? Is the default prompt used as part of Cline just not very performant with the models I'm using? (And what prompts should I try?)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Given that we have fine-tunes for specific tasks of models, such as qwen2.5-coder, the tool-use version that I'm using, and tool-use versions of R1 (and distilled) models, should the fine-tunes become even more specific so that a specific &amp;quot;irregular&amp;quot; model can be assigned to the specific &amp;quot;irregular&amp;quot; task? For example, a super-agent would assign a coding model fine-tuned on AI coding using ROCM or OneAPI rather than the typical model which will default to CUDA?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Given that I have access to Sonnet 3.5 through the copilot API as a powerful model but frequently run into rate limits when using the agent mode, are there any existing tools that allow powerful agents through the copilot api to leverage cheap (but focused) local llms?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;And finally, any interesting coding/tool-use/planning models that fit coding/software engineering usecases that fit nicely into 20GB VRAM with room to spare?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Hoak-em"&gt; /u/Hoak-em &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilza8m/my_experience_trying_out_coding_agents/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilza8m/my_experience_trying_out_coding_agents/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on fine-tuning LLMs a bit later than everyone else (among the ones I know), and I’ve struggled to understand why I’m doing what I’m doing. I’ve compiled a small collection of everything I know about fine-tuning LLMs or transformer models for specific use cases. I’d like to hear your thoughts on these things!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, please share your experiences too! I'd love to hear those even more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you shouldn't fine-tune:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - When wanting the model to respond in a &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; way in rare circumstances. That's what prompt engineering is for! Don't use a bulldozer to kill a fly.&lt;br /&gt; - For the model to learn &amp;quot;new knowledge&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; - When you have too little data. (Though it's being disproven that low data performs better than high data for mathematical reasoning! Still in research!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the right data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You want the model to learn the patterns, not the words. You need enough diverse samples, not large data of the same kind.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;More data isn't always better. Don't dump all the data you have onto the model.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Every training example needs a clear input and a clear output. And optionally, context text to add additional information.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The dataset must have enough cases, edge cases and everything in between. You can also augment the dataset by using data from a Larger LLM.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pack your datasets! They help!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Determine if you're performing open-ended, Instruction or chat-based text generation**.**&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the right model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You don't need a 100B model for every task you have. For real-world applications, 1-13B models are more practical.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You must check the licensing to see if you use the model for commercial use cases. Some have very strict licensing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A good starting point? Llama-3.1-8B.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General fine-tuning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;An 8B model needs ~16GB of memory to load up. So, mixed precision and quantisations are used to initialise a model in case of memory restrictions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the batch size can't be increased, use the Gradient-accumulation approach. General accumulations are done for overall batch sizes of 16,32,128.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Save checkpoints regularly, and use &lt;code&gt;resume_from_checkpoint=True&lt;/code&gt; when needed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Consider using Model-parallelism or Data-parallelism techniques to work across multiple devices for large-scale training.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Documentation will help in surprisingly weird situations. Maintain it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LoRA finetuning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don't use QLoRA for everything. Use it only if you realise that the model couldn't fit your device. Using QLoRA roughly comes with 39% more training time while saving roughly a third of the memory needed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;SGD+Learning rate schedulers are useful. But using LR Schedulers with other optimizers like AdamW/Adam seems to give diminishing returns. &lt;em&gt;(need to check&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;sophia&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;optimiser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A high number of training epochs doesn't bode well for LoRA finetuning.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Despite the general understanding of lora_alpha ~2*lora_rank, it's sometimes better to check with other values too! These two parameters need meticulous adjustments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The training times found outside might be confusing. It would take too long on your PC, but it seems very fast on the reported sites. Well, your choice of GPU would also be implicating the speed. So keep that in mind.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LoRA is actively changing. Don't forget to check and test its different versions, such as LoRA-plus, DoRA, LoFTQ, AdaLoRA, DyLoRA, LoRA-FA etc. (still need to check many of these...)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the finetuning strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine the right task:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;You must &amp;quot;adapt&amp;quot; the model for task-specific finetuning, such as code generation, document summarisation, and question answering.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;For domain-specific needs like medical, financial, legal, etc., you need to push the model to update its knowledge =&amp;gt; Use RAG when applicable or fine-tune the entire model. (EDIT: This is supposed to be re-training, not fine-tuning.)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Utilise pruning depending on the kind of task you're trying to perform. Generally, in production environments, the faster the inference, the better the performance. In this case, pruning+finetuning helps. We need to keep that in mind.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/The-Silvervein"&gt; /u/The-Silvervein &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilkamr/a_comprehensive_overview_of_everything_i_know/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilkamr/a_comprehensive_overview_of_everything_i_know/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, a local model with a size of 7B-9B has an intelligence level that is roughly equivalent to gpt-3.5 from two years ago. OpenAI has not disclosed the parameter size of gpt-3.5. I searched online comments, and there is no exact data, but it is estimated to be in the order of 100B parameters, which means that in 2 years, we have been able to use the most advanced large model from 2 years ago locally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering that machine performance will also have a considerable improvement in 2 years, this linear extrapolation suggests that in 2 years, we can expect to run a MoE large model with a size of 50B-70B on par with DeepSeek R1 locally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an optimistic estimate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Still_Potato_415"&gt; /u/Still_Potato_415 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im180h/speculation_of_the_local_large_model_after_2_years/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im180h/speculation_of_the_local_large_model_after_2_years/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

You can try it &lt;a href="https://github.com/horus-ai-labs/DistillFlow/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; My conclusion: Prefer distillation over fine-tuning when there is a substantial gap between the larger and smaller model on the target dataset. In such cases, distillation can effectively transfer knowledge, leading to significantly better performance than standard fine-tuning alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/darkItachi94"&gt; /u/darkItachi94 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im001e/i_built_an_open_source_library_to_perform/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im001e/i_built_an_open_source_library_to_perform/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Glyphstral is the result of that deep dive, trained to work with my &amp;quot;Glyph Code Logic Flow&amp;quot; framework. It's all about getting models to use structured, deductive symbolic logic, which you can read all about over here: &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fseverian42%2FComputational-Model-for-Symbolic-Representations%2Ftree%2Fmain"&gt;https://github.com/severian42/Computational-Model-for-Symbolic-Representations/tree/main&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been very low on time so I haven't been able to make the GGUF's, as I know most of you will need those instead of the MLX version, so apologies for the delay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A benchmark is also in the works! I honestly just didn't feel like holding off on the release so that some people could start testing it right away. More updates coming this week, just think of this as a soft launch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is very much a first step, and there's definitely tons more to do, but I'm genuinely excited about where this is heading. Check out the Hugging Face repo, give it a spin, and let me know what you think! Docs and more info are up there too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huge thanks for all the initial interest and encouragement on the first post.

    <title>How is it that Google's Gemini Pro 2.0 Experimental 02-05 Tops the LLM Arena Charts, but seems to perform badly in real world testing?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I'm curious if anyone can shed some light on the recently released Gemini Pro 2.0 model's performance on LLM Arena vs real world experimentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard"&gt;https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have tried Gemini Pro 2.0 for many tasks and found that it hallucinated more than any other SOTA model. This was coding tasks, basic logic tasks, tasks where it presumed that it had search results when it did not and just made up information. Other tasks where it did not have the information in the model and instead provided completely made up data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I understand that LLM arena does not require this sort of validation, but I worry that the confidence with which it provides incorrect answers is polluting the responses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even in Coding on LLMA, 2.0 pro experimental seemingly tops the charts, yet in any basic testing it is nowhere close to claude, which simply provides better code solutions with fewer errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 95% CLI is +15/-13, which is quite high meaning that certainty of the score has not been established, but still, has anyone found it to be reliable?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/RMCPhoto"&gt; /u/RMCPhoto &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im4d3y/how_is_it_that_googles_gemini_pro_20_experimental/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1im4d3y/how_is_it_that_googles_gemini_pro_20_experimental/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Check out the details here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/doc/en/DeepseekR1_V3_tutorial.md"&gt;https://github.com/kvcache-ai/ktransformers/blob/main/doc/en/DeepseekR1_V3_tutorial.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some rationale behind this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why CPU/GPU Hybrid Inference?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek's MLA operators are highly computationally intensive. While running everything on CPU is possible, offloading the heavy computations to the GPU results in a massive performance boost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Where Does the Speedup Come From?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Expert Offload: Unlike traditional layer-based or KVCache offloading (as seen in llama.cpp), we offload the expert computation to the CPU and MLA/KVCache to GPU, aligning perfectly with DeepSeek’s architecture for optimal efficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Intel AMX Optimization – Our AMX-accelerated kernel is meticulously tuned, running several times faster than existing llama.cpp implementations. We plan to open-source this kernel after cleansing and are considering upstream contributions to llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Why Intel CPUs?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel is currently the only CPU vendor that supports AMX-like instructions, which delivers significantly better performance compared to AVX-only alternatives. BUT, we also support AMD CPUs and due to the Expert Offload it will also be faster than the current llama.cpp&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/CombinationNo780"&gt; /u/CombinationNo780 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilzcwm/671b_deepseekr1v3q4_on_a_single_machine_2_xeon/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ilzcwm/671b_deepseekr1v3q4_on_a_single_machine_2_xeon/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>
