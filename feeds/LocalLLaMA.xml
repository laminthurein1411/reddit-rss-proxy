    <title>Sharing my unorthodox home setup, and how I use local LLMs</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for the past year and a half+ I've been tinkering with, planning out and updating my home setup, and figured that with 2025 here, I'd join in on sharing where it's at. It's an expensive little home lab, though nothing nearly as fancy or cool as what other folks have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;- I have 2 &amp;quot;assistants&amp;quot; (1 large and 1 small, with each assistant made up of between 4-7 models working together), and a development machine/assistant. The dev box simulates the smaller assistant for dev purposes. Each assistant has offline wiki access, vision capability, and I use them for all my hobby work/random stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hardware is a mix of stuff I already had, or stuff I bought for LLM tinkering. I'm a software dev and tinkering with stuff is one of my main hobbies, so I threw a fair bit of money at it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Refurb M2 Ultra Mac Studio w/1 TB internal drive + USB C 2TB drive&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Refurb M2 Max Macbook Pro 96GB&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Refurb M2 Mac Mini base model&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Windows 10 Desktop w/ RTX 4090&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total Hardware Pricing: ~$5,500 for studio refurbished + ~$3000 for Macbook Pro refurbished + ~$500 Mac Mini refurbished (&lt;em&gt;already owned&lt;/em&gt;) + ~$2000 Windows desktop (&lt;em&gt;already owned&lt;/em&gt;) == &lt;strong&gt;$10,500 in total hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The Software&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I do most of my inference using KoboldCPP&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I do vision inference through Ollama and my dev box uses Ollama&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I run all inference through WilmerAI, which handles all the workflows and domain routing. This lets me use as many models as I want to power the assistants, and also setup workflows for coding windows, use the offline wiki api, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;For zero-shots, simple dev questions and other quick hits, I use Open WebUI as my front end. Otherwise I use SillyTavern for more involved programming tasks and for my assistants. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;All of the gaming quality of life features in ST double over very nicely for assistant work and programming lol&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The Setup&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mac Mini acts as one of three WilmerAI &amp;quot;cores&amp;quot;; the mini is the Wilmer home core, and also acts as the web server for all of my instances of ST and Open WebUI. There are 6 instances of Wilmer on this machine, each with its own purpose. The Macbook Pro is the Wilmer portable core (3 instances of Wilmer), and the Windows Desktop is the Wilmer dev core (2 instances of Wilmer).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the models for the Wilmer home core are on the Mac Studio, and I hope to eventually add another box to expand the home core.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each core acts independently from the others, meaning doing things like removing the macbook from the network won't hurt the home core. Each core has its own text models, offline wiki api, and vision model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have 2 &amp;quot;assistants&amp;quot; set up, with the intention to later add a third. Each assistant is essentially built to be an advanced &amp;quot;rubber duck&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;as in the rubber duck programming method where you talk through a problem to an inanimate object and it helps you solve this problem&lt;/em&gt;). Each assistant is built entirely to talk through problems with me, of any kind, and help me solve them by challenging me, answering my questions, or using a specific set of instructions on how to think through issues in unique ways. Each assistant is built to be different, and thus solve things differently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each assistant is made up of multiple LLMs. Some examples would be: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A responder model, which does the talking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A RAG model, which I use for pulling data from the offline wikipedia api for factual questions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A reasoning model, for thinking through a response before the responder answers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A coding model, for handle code issues and math issues.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two assistants are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RolandAI&lt;/strong&gt;- powered by the home core. All of Roland's models are generally running on the Mac Studio, and is by far the more powerful of the two. Its got conversation memories going back to early 2024, and I primarily use it. At this point I have to prune the memories regularly lol. I'm saving the pruned memories for when I get a secondary memory system into Wilmer that I can backload them into.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SomeOddCodeBot&lt;/strong&gt;- powered by the portable core. All these models run on the Macbook. This is my &amp;quot;second opinion&amp;quot; bot, and also my portable bot for when I'm on the road. It's setup is specifically different from Roland, beyond just being smaller, so that they will &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; differently about problems.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each assistant's persona and problem solving instructions exist only within the workflows of Wilmer, meaning that front ends like SillyTavern have no information in a character card for it, Open WebUI has no prompt for it, etc. Roland, as an entity, is a specific series of workflow nodes that are designed to act, speak and process problems/prompts in a very specific way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I generally have a total of about 8 front end SillyTavern/Open WebUI windows open. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Four ST windows. Two are for the two assistants individually, and one is a group chat that have both in case I want the two assistants to process a longer/more complex concept together. This replaced my old &amp;quot;development group&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I have a fourth ST window for my home core &amp;quot;Coding&amp;quot; Wilmer instance, which is a workflow that is just for coding questions (for example, one iteration of this was using QwQ + Qwen2.5 32b coder, which the response quality landed somewhere between ChatGPT 4o and o1. Tis slow though). &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;After that, I have 4 Open WebUI windows for coding workflows, reasoning workflows and a encyclopedic questions using the offline wiki api.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;How I Use Them&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roland is obviously going to be the more powerful of the two assistants; I have 180GB, give or take, of VRAM to build out its model structure with. SomeOddCodeBot has about 76GB of VRAM, but has a similar structure just using smaller models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I use these assistants for any personal projects that I have; I can't use them for anything work related, but I do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of personal dev and tinkering. Whenever I have an idea, whenever I'm checking something, etc I usually bounce the ideas off of one or both assistants. If I'm trying to think through a problem I might do similarly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another example is code reviews: I often pass in the before/after code to both bots, and ask for a general analysis of what's what. I'm reviewing it myself as well, but the bots help me find little things I might have missed, and generally make me feel better that I didn't miss anything. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The code reviews will often be for my own work, as well as anyone committing to my personal projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the dev core, I use Ollama as the main inference because I can do a neat trick with Wilmer on it. As long as each individual model fits on 20GB of VRAM, I can use as many models as I want in the workflow. Ollama API calls let you pass the model name in, and it unloads the current model and loads the new model instead, so I can have each Wilmer node just pass in a different model name. This lets me simulate the 76GB portable core with only 20GB, since I only use smaller models on the portable core, so I can have a dev assistant to break and mess with while I'm updating Wilmer code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;2025 Plans&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I plan to convert the dev core into a coding agent box and build a Wilmer agent jobs system; think of like an agent wrapping an agent lol. I want something like Aider running as the worker agent, that is controlled by a wrapping agent that calls a Roland Wilmer instance to manage the coder. ie- Roland is in charge of the agent doing the coding. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I've been using Roland to code review me, help me come up with architectures for things, etc for a while. The goal of that is to tune the workflows so that I can eventually just put Roland in charge of a coding agent running on the Windows box. Write down what I want, get back a higher quality version than if I just left the normal agent to its devices; something QAed by a workflow thinking in a specific way that I want it to think. If that works well, I'd try to expand that out to have N number of agents running off of runpod boxes for larger dev work.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All of this is just a really high level plan atm, but I became more interested in it after finding out about that $1m competition =D What was a &amp;quot;that's a neat idea&amp;quot; became a &amp;quot;I really want to try this&amp;quot;. So this whole plan may fail miserably, but I do have some hope based on how I'm already using Wilmer today.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I want to add Home Assistant integration in and start making home automation workflows in Wilmer. Once I've got some going, I'll add a new Wilmer core to the house, as well as a third assistant, to manage it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I've got my eye on an NVidia digits... might get it to expand Roland a bit.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyhow, that's pretty much it. It's an odd setup, but I thought some of you might get a kick out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/SomeOddCodeGuy"&gt; /u/SomeOddCodeGuy &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1kz1c/sharing_my_unorthodox_home_setup_and_how_i_use/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1kz1c/sharing_my_unorthodox_home_setup_and_how_i_use/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

This one focuses on an SGEMM implementation that outperforms cuBLAS with its (modified?) CUTLASS kernel across a wide range of matrix sizes. The blog delves into benchmarking code on CUDA devices and explains the algorithm's design along with optimization techniques. These include inlined PTX, asynchronous memory copies, double-buffering, avoiding shared memory bank conflicts, and efficient coalesced storage using shared memory. The code is super easy to tweak, so you can customize it for your projects with kernel fusion or just drop it into your libraries as-is. If you have any questions, feel free to comment or send me a direct message - I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions you may have! Below, I've included performance comparisons (with both locked and unlocked clocks) against cuBLAS and Simon Boehm’s highly cited work, which is now integrated into llamafile aka tinyBLAS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blog post: &lt;a href="https://salykova.github.io/sgemm-gpu"&gt;https://salykova.github.io/sgemm-gpu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Code: &lt;a href="https://github.com/salykova/sgemm.cu"&gt;https://github.com/salykova/sgemm.cu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/y3pgixh4l7de1.png?width=1256&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cce30a78791965503a0fa340646a537de1d57195"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y3pgixh4l7de1.png?width=1256&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cce30a78791965503a0fa340646a537de1d57195&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://preview.redd.it/b5vqz7c5l7de1.png?width=1253&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2cf2103c8c7426dedfb70deb05d9c54c320e6808"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b5vqz7c5l7de1.png?width=1253&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2cf2103c8c7426dedfb70deb05d9c54c320e6808&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/salykova"&gt; /u/salykova &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i25jas/beating_cublas_in_singleprecision_general_matrix/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i25jas/beating_cublas_in_singleprecision_general_matrix/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got Deepseek running on a bunch of old 10GB Nvidia P102-100's on PCIE 1.0 x1 risers. (GPU's built for mining)&lt;br /&gt; Spread across 3 machines, connected via 1gb lan and through a firewall! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bought these GPU's for $30 each, (not for this purpose lol)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough the hardest part is that Llama.cpp wanted enough cpu ram to load the model before moving it to VRAM. Had to run it at Q2 because of this.&lt;br /&gt; Will try again at Q4 when I get some more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speed, a whopping &lt;strong&gt;3.6 T/s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering this setup has literally everything going against it, not half bad really.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are curious, without the GPUs, the CPU server alone starts around 2.4T/s but even after 1k tokens it was down to 1.8T/s&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was only seeing like 30MB/s on the network, but might try upgrading everything to 10G lan just to see if it matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Conscious_Cut_6144"&gt; /u/Conscious_Cut_6144 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1p0yb/running_deepseek_v3_with_a_box_of_scraps_but_not/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1p0yb/running_deepseek_v3_with_a_box_of_scraps_but_not/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I say accidentally because that wasn’t the goal of my project, but as people and companies adopted it, they requested similar features. Over time, I ended up with something that feels like an alternative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main benefit of both services is elevated rate limits without subscription, and the ability to easily switch models using OpenAI-compatible API. That's not different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unique benefits to my gateway include integration with the Chat and &lt;a href="https://glama.ai/mcp/servers"&gt;MCP ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, more advanced analytics/logging, and reportedly lower latency and greater stability than OpenRouter. Pricing is similar, and we process several billion tokens daily. Having addressed feedback from current users, I’m now looking to the broader community for ideas on where to take the project next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are your painpoints with OpenRouter?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/punkpeye"&gt; /u/punkpeye &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1owp1/openrouter_users_what_feature_are_you_missing/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1owp1/openrouter_users_what_feature_are_you_missing/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>I accidentally built an open alternative to Google AI Studio</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I had a mini heart attack when I discovered Google AI Studio, a product that looked (at first glance) just like the tool I've been building for 5 months. However, I dove in and was super relieved once I got into the details. There were a bunch of differences, which I've detailed below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought I’d share what I have, in case anyone has been using G AI Sudio, and might want to check out my &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln"&gt;rapid prototyping tool on Github, called Kiln&lt;/a&gt;. There are some similarities, but there are also some big differences when it comes to privacy, collaboration, model support, fine-tuning, and ML techniques. I built Kiln because I've been building AI products for ~10 years (most recently at Apple, and my own startup &amp;amp; MSFT before that), and I wanted to build an easy to use, privacy focused, open source AI tooling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Differences:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Model Support: Kiln allows any LLM (including Gemini/Gemma) through a ton of hosts: Ollama, OpenRouter, OpenAI, etc. Google supports only Gemini &amp;amp; Gemma via Google Cloud.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fine Tuning: Google lets you fine tune only Gemini, with at most 500 samples. Kiln has no limits on data size, 9 models you can tune in a few clicks (no code), and support for tuning any open model via Unsloth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Data Privacy: Kiln can't access your data (it runs locally, data stays local); Google stores everything. Kiln can run/train local models (Ollama/Unsloth/LiteLLM); Google always uses their cloud.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collaboration: Google is single user, while Kiln allows unlimited users/collaboration.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ML Techniques: Google has standard prompting. Kiln has standard prompts, chain-of-thought/reasoning, and auto-prompts (using your dataset for multi-shot).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dataset management: Google has a table with max 500 rows. Kiln has powerful dataset management for teams with Git sync, tags, unlimited rows, human ratings, and more.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Python Library: Google is UI only. Kiln has a python library for extending it for when you need more than the UI can offer.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open Source: Google’s is completely proprietary and private source. Kiln’s library is MIT open source; the UI isn’t MIT, but it is 100% source-available, on Github, and free.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Similarities: Both handle structured data well, both have a prompt library, both have similar “Run” UX, both had user friendly UIs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to check Kiln out, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln"&gt;here's the GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.getkiln.ai"&gt;docs are here&lt;/a&gt;. Getting started is super easy - it's a one-click install to get setup and running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m very interested in any feedback or feature requests (model requests, integrations with other tools, etc.) I'm currently working on comprehensive evals, so feedback on what you'd like to see in that area would be super helpful. My hope is to make something as easy to use as G AI Studio, as powerful as Vertex AI, all while open and private.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance! I’m happy to answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side note: I’m usually pretty good at competitive research before starting a project. I had looked up Google's &amp;quot;AI Studio&amp;quot; before I started. However, I found and looked at &amp;quot;Vertex AI Studio&amp;quot;, which is a completely different type of product. How one company can have 2 products with almost identical names is beyond me...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/davernow"&gt; /u/davernow &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1ffid/i_accidentally_built_an_open_alternative_to/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i1ffid/i_accidentally_built_an_open_alternative_to/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I tried something similar but I’m no PhD student and the Math is beyond me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TLDR; Google Research introduces Titans, a new Al model that learns to store information in a dedicated &amp;quot;long-term memory&amp;quot; at test time. This means it can adapt whenever it sees something surprising, updating its memory on-the-fly. Unlike standard Transformers that handle only the current text window, Titans keep a deeper, more permanent record-similar to short-term vs. long-term memory in humans. The method scales more efficiently (linear time) than traditional Transformers(qudratic time) for very long input sequences. i.e theoretically infinite context windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be mistaken, this isn’t just a next-gen “artificial intelligence”, but a step towards to “artificial consciousness” with persistent memory - IF we define consciousness as the ability to model internally(self-modeling), organize, integrate, and recollect of data (with respect to a real-time input)as posited by IIT… would love to hear y’all’s thoughts 🧠👀&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/AIGuy3000"&gt; /u/AIGuy3000 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i26nk4/attention_is_all_you_need_pt_2_titans_learning_to/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i26nk4/attention_is_all_you_need_pt_2_titans_learning_to/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
