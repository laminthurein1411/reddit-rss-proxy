    <title>Intuitive explanation on diffusion language models (dLLMs) and why they may be far superior to autoregressive for most uses (append &amp; amend VS mutate &amp; defragment)</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been preaching diffusion LLMs for a month now and I believe I can explain clearly why it could be superior to autoregressive, or perhaps they are two complementary hemispheres in a more complete being. Before getting into the theory, let's look at one application first, how I think coding agents are gonna go down with diffusion:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diffusion LLMs with reinforcement learning for agentic coding are going to be utterly nuts. Imagine memory-mapping a region of the context to some text documents and giving the model commands to scroll the view or follow references and jump around files. DLLMs can edit files directly without an intermediate apply model or outputting diffs. Any mutation made by the model to the tokens in the context would directly be saved to disk in the corresponding file. These models don't accumulate deltas, they remain at ground truth. This means that the running representation of the code it's editing is always in its least complex representation. It isn't some functional operation chain of &lt;code&gt;original + delta + ...&lt;/code&gt; it's mutating the original directly. (inherently less mode-collapsing) Furthermore the memory-mapped file region can be anywhere in the context. The next generation of coding agents is probably like a chunk of context that is allocated to contain some memory-mapped file editing &amp;amp; reading regions, and some prompts or reasoning area. LLMs could have their own &amp;quot;vim&amp;quot; equivalent for code navigation, and maybe they could even fit multiple regions in one context to navigate them separately in parallel and cross-reference data. The model could teach itself to choose dynamically between one large view buffer over one file, or many tiny views over many files, dividing up the context window to have multiple parallel probe points, which could be more useful for tracing an exception. Imagine the policies that can be discovered automatically by RL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One creative inference system I am eager to try is to set-up a 1D cellular automaton which generates floats over the text in an anisotropic landscape fashion (think perlin noise, how it is irregular and cannot be predicted) and calculating the perplexity and varentropy on each token, and then injecting the tokens with noise that is masked by the varentropy &amp;amp; automaton's activation, or injecting space or tokens. This essentially creates a guided search at high variance pressure points in the text and causes the text to &amp;quot;unroll&amp;quot; wherever ambiguity lies. Each unrolling point may result in another unrelated part of the text shooting up in varentropy because it suddenly changes the meaning, so this could be a potent test-time scaling loop that goes on for a very long time unrolling a small seed to document to a massive well-thought out essay or thesis or whatever creative work you are asking the system. This is a strategy in the near future I believe could do things we might call super-intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An autoregressive model cannot do this because it can only append and amend. It can call tools like sed to mutate text, but it's not differentiable and doesn't learn mechanics of mutation. Diffusion models are more resistant to degeneration and can recover better. If an output degenerates in an autoregressive model, it has to amend the crap (&amp;quot;I apologize, I have made a mistake&amp;quot;) and cannot actually erase from its context window. It can't defragment text or optimize it like diffusers, certainly not as a native operation. Diffusion LLMs will result in models that &amp;quot;just do things&amp;quot;. The model doesn't have to say &amp;quot;wait, I see the problem&amp;quot; because the code is labeled as a problem-state by nature of its encoding and there are natural gradients that the model can climb or navigate that bridge problem-state to correctness-state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diffusion language models cut out an unnecessary operation, which albeit does raise question as to safety. We will not understand anymore why the ideas or code that appears on the screen is as it is unless we decisively RL a scratchpad, training the model to reserve some context buffer for a reasoning scratch pad. BTW as we said earlier with diffusion LLMs we can do in-painting just like image models, by masking which tokens should be frozen or allowed to change. That means you can hard-code a sequential unmasking schedule over certain views, and possibly get sequential-style reasoning in parallel with the memory-mapped code editing regions. And this is why I took such a long roundabout way to this explanation. Now finally we can see why diffusion language models are simply superior: they can be trained to support reasoning in parallel as they edit code. &lt;strong&gt;Diffusion LLMs generalize the autoregressive model through sequential unmasking schedules, and allow the model to be progressively taken out of distribution into the full-space of non-sequential idea formation that is private to the human brain and not found in any dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; By bootstrapping this spectrum, now humans can manually program it and bias the models closer to the way it works for us, or hand-design something even more powerful or obtuse than human imagination. Like all models, it does not &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; but rather guesses / discovers a weight structure that can explain the dataset. The base output of a diffusion LLM is not that newsworthy. Sure it's faster and it looks really cool, but at a glance it's not clear why this would be better than what the same dataset could train in auto-regressive. No, it's the fact that we have a new pool of representations and operations that we can rearrange to construct something closer to the way that humans use their brains, or directly crystallizing it by random search guided by RL objectives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We should think of diffusion LLMs as an &lt;strong&gt;evolution operator or physics engine for a context window&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a super-massive ruleset which defines how a given context (text document) is allowed to mutate, iterate, or be stepped forward in time. It's a scaled up cellular automaton. What everybody should keep in mind here is that diffusion LLMs can mutate infinitely. There is no 'maximum context window' in a dLLM because the append / amend history is unnecessary. The model can work on a document for 13 hours, optimizing tokens. Text is transformative, compounds on itselfs, and rewrites itself. Text is self-aware and cognizant of its own state of being. In an image diffusion model, the rules are programmed by a prompt that is separate from the output. But language diffusion models are different, because the prompt and the output are the same. Diffusion LLMs are more resistant to out of distribution areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/psychonucks"&gt; /u/psychonucks &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksrxm7/intuitive_explanation_on_diffusion_language/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksrxm7/intuitive_explanation_on_diffusion_language/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Why has no one been talking about Open Hands so far?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just stumbled across Open Hands while checking out Mistral’s new Devstral model—and honestly, I was really impressed. The agent itself seems super capable, yet I feel like barely anyone is talking about it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s weird is that OpenHands has 54k+ stars on GitHub. For comparison: Roo Code sits at ~14k, and Cline is around 44k. So it’s clearly on the radar of devs. But when you go look it up on YouTube or Reddit—nothing. Practically no real discussion, no deep dives, barely any content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I’m just sitting here wondering… why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From what I’ve seen so far, it seems just as capable as the other top open-source agents. So are you guys using OpenHands? Is there some kind of limitation I’ve missed? Or is it just a case of bad marketing/no community hype?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curious to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, do you think models specifically trained for a certain agent is the future? Are we going to see more agent specific models going forward and how big do you think is the effort to create these fine tunes? Will it depend on collaborations with big names the likes of Mistral or will Roo et al. be able to provide fine tunes on their own?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Mr_Moonsilver"&gt; /u/Mr_Moonsilver &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksfos8/why_has_no_one_been_talking_about_open_hands_so/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksfos8/why_has_no_one_been_talking_about_open_hands_so/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I think AutoGen added Magentic as an Agent type in AutoGen, but then it kinda of fell off my radar until today when they released &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magentic-UI - &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Magentic-UI"&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/Magentic-UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From their GitHub:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Magentic-UI is a research prototype of a human-centered interface powered by a multi-agent system that can browse and perform actions on the web, generate and execute code, and generate and analyze files. Magentic-UI is especially useful for web tasks that require actions on the web (e.g., filling a form, customizing a food order), deep navigation through websites not indexed by search engines (e.g., filtering flights, finding a link from a personal site) or tasks that need web navigation and code execution (e.g., generate a chart from online data).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What differentiates Magentic-UI from other browser use offerings is its transparent and controllable interface that allows for efficient human-in-the-loop involvement. Magentic-UI is built using AutoGen and provides a platform to study human-agent interaction and experiment with web agents. Key features include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Co-Planning: Collaboratively create and approve step-by-step plans using chat and the plan editor. 🤝 Co-Tasking: Interrupt and guide the task execution using the web browser directly or through chat. Magentic-UI can also ask for clarifications and help when needed. 🛡️ Action Guards: Sensitive actions are only executed with explicit user approvals. 🧠 Plan Learning and Retrieval: Learn from previous runs to improve future task automation and save them in a plan gallery. Automatically or manually retrieve saved plans in future tasks. 🔀 Parallel Task Execution: You can run multiple tasks in parallel and session status indicators will let you know when Magentic-UI needs your input or has completed the task.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supposedly you can use it with Ollama and other local LLM providers. I’ll be trying this out when I have some time. Anyone else got this working locally yet? WDYT of it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Porespellar"&gt; /u/Porespellar &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksuycv"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksuycv/microsoft_releases_magenticui_could_this_finally/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

The current checkpoint on Hugging Face supports text and vision input, with full multimodal features expected soon.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient Architecture:&lt;/strong&gt; Gemma 3n models feature a novel architecture that allows them to run with a smaller number of effective parameters (E2B and E4B variants mentioned). They also utilize a Matformer architecture for nesting multiple models.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Resource Devices:&lt;/strong&gt; These models are specifically designed for efficient execution on low-resource devices.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Parameter Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; This technology helps reduce resource requirements, allowing the models to operate at an effective size of 2B and 4B parameters.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Trained on a dataset of approximately 11 trillion tokens, including web documents, code, mathematics, images, and audio, with a knowledge cutoff of June 2024.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intended Uses:&lt;/strong&gt; Suited for tasks like content creation (text, code, etc.), chatbots, text summarization, and image/audio data extraction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preview Version:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep in mind this is a preview version, intended for use with Google AI Edge.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You'll need to agree to Google's usage license on Hugging Face to access the model files. You can find it by searching for google/gemma-3n-E4B-it-litert-preview on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Rare-Programmer-1747"&gt; /u/Rare-Programmer-1747 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksmiwz/new_gemma_3n_e4b_preview_from_google_lands_on/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ksmiwz/new_gemma_3n_e4b_preview_from_google_lands_on/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

    <title>Notes on AlphaEvolve: Are we closing in on Singularity?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepMind released the AlphaEvolve paper last week, which, considering what they have achieved, is arguably one of the most important papers of the year. But I found the discourse around it was very thin, not many who actively cover the AI space have talked much about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, I made some notes on the important aspects of AlphaEvolve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;DeepMind calls it an &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot;, but it was not your run-of-the-mill agent, but a meta-cognitive system. The agent architecture has the following components&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Problem: An entire codebase or a part of it marked with # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and # EVOLVE-BLOCK-END. Only this part of it will be evolved.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;LLM ensemble: They used Gemini 2.0 Pro for complex reasoning and 2.5 flash for faster operations.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Evolutionary database: The most important part, the database uses map-elite and Island architecture to store solutions and inspirations. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Prompt Sampling: A combination of previous best results, inspirations, and human contexts for improving the existing solution.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Evaluation Framework: A Python function for evaluating the answers, and it returns array of scalars.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Working in brief&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The database maintains &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; programs marked for improvement and &amp;quot;inspirations&amp;quot; for adding diversity to the solution. (The name &amp;quot;AlphaEvolve&amp;quot; itself actually comes from it being an &amp;quot;Alpha&amp;quot; series agent that &amp;quot;Evolves&amp;quot; solutions, rather than just this parent/inspiration idea).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it generally flows: the AlphaEvolve system gets the initial codebase. Then, for each step, the &lt;strong&gt;prompt sampler&lt;/strong&gt; cleverly picks out parent program(s) to work on and some inspiration programs. It bundles these up with &lt;strong&gt;feedback from past attempts (like scores or even what an LLM thought about previous versions)&lt;/strong&gt;, plus any handy human context. This whole package goes to the LLMs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new solution they come up with (the &amp;quot;child&amp;quot;) gets graded by the &lt;strong&gt;evaluation function&lt;/strong&gt;. Finally, these child solutions, with their new grades, are stored back in the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The Outcome&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most interesting part even with older models like Gemini 2.0 Pro and Flash, when AlphaEvolve took on over 50 open math problems, it managed to match the best solutions out there for 75% of them, actually found better answers for another 20%, and only came up short on a tiny 5%!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Out of all, DeepMind is most proud of AlphaEvolve surpassing Strassen's 56-year-old algorithm for 4x4 complex matrix multiplication by finding a method with 48 scalar multiplications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And also the agent improved Google's infra by speeding up Gemini LLM training by ~1%, improving data centre job scheduling to recover ~0.7% of fleet-wide compute resources, optimising TPU circuit designs, and accelerating compiler-generated code for AI kernels by up to 32%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the best agent scaffolding to date. The fact that they pulled this off with an outdated Gemini, imagine what they can do with the current SOTA. This makes it one thing clear: what we're lacking for efficient agent swarms doing tasks is the right abstractions. Though the cost of operation is not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a detailed blog post, check this out: &lt;a href="https://composio.dev/blog/alphaevolve-evolutionary-agent-from-deepmind/"&gt;AlphaEvolve: the self-evolving agent from DeepMind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It'd be interesting to see if they ever release it in the wild or if any other lab picks it up. This is certainly the best frontier for building agents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to know your thoughts on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/SunilKumarDash"&gt; /u/SunilKumarDash &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kstdhn/notes_on_alphaevolve_are_we_closing_in_on/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kstdhn/notes_on_alphaevolve_are_we_closing_in_on/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
