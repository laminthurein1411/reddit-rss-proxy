    <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my friend was telling me about AI implementation at his company the othe day. he said they developed their own &amp;quot;secure GPT&amp;quot; which while limited compared to flagship models can do basic tasks like OCR, translation, generate text, and query PDF/txt files. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then he mentioned the whole company went full google a couple of years ago. From chromebooks to literally every single piece of sensitive or industry secret being in some google sheet or google doc file somewhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wondered then if the employees couldn't just use the more recent Gemini models or the Google AI studio or NotebookLM since it's plausible these were already trained on their company data? Or is there some legal protection that prevents Alphabet from training AIs based on google workplace environment?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just told my friend he's be better off running Deepseek R1 locally if he's that worried about security, but ofc it's still a considerable investment. What do y'all think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/hjras"&gt; /u/hjras &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1it5qw9/at_a_friends_company_they_have_developed_their/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1it5qw9/at_a_friends_company_they_have_developed_their/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

We went pretty far afield after that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tell me a little about Lambda Cold Dark Matter, the theory, its controversies, and give a frank assessment of how much of it is actually verifiable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) is a leading cosmological model that attempts to explain the evolution and structure of the universe on large scales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overview:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ΛCDM model combines two key components:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cold Dark Matter (CDM): A type of dark matter that interacts with normal matter only through gravity, making it invisible but detectable through its gravitational effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lambda (Λ): The cosmological constant, representing the energy density of the vacuum, which is thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Theoretical Framework:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ΛCDM model is based on the following assumptions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Relativity (GR) describes gravity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The universe evolved from a very hot, dense state in the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Predictions and Successes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Large-scale structure: ΛCDM predicts the formation of galaxy clusters, superclusters, and the web-like structure of the universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The model accurately predicts the CMB's black-body spectrum and anisotropies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO): ΛCDM agrees with observations of BAO, which are a signature of the universe's expansion history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Controversies and Challenges:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dark Matter: The existence of dark matter is inferred, but its nature remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dark Energy: The cosmological constant (Λ) is not well understood, and its value is difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tension between predictions and observations: Some observed features, such as the &amp;quot;galaxy rotation curve problem&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;missing satellites&amp;quot; issue, are not fully explained by ΛCDM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verifiability:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the ΛCDM model has been successful in explaining many large-scale phenomena, its verifiability is limited by:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lack of direct detection: Dark matter and dark energy remain invisible, making it challenging to directly verify their existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Model dependencies: The interpretation of observations relies heavily on the underlying assumptions and the specific implementation of the ΛCDM model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assessment:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ΛCDM model is a well-established framework for understanding the universe's evolution, but its limitations and controversies should be acknowledged:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Approximately 95% of the universe's mass-energy budget is composed of dark matter and dark energy, which are not directly observable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ongoing research: New observations, such as those from the Simons Observatory or the Square Kilometre Array, will help refine the model and potentially resolve some of the existing tensions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the ΛCDM model has been successful in explaining many phenomena, its verifiability is limited by the lack of direct detection and the reliance on indirect inference. Ongoing research and new observations will continue to refine our understanding of the universe's evolution and structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that we should likely be calling it &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;Dark Matter&amp;quot; because we really don't know if some indeterminate form of matter is the cause of the additional gravity we measure. What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding Dark Matter and Dark Gravity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept of dark matter has been a subject of interest in astrophysics, with scientists like Neil DeGrasse Tyson proposing alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. One such proposal is to refer to it as &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Dark Matter&amp;quot;. This idea is based on the notion that the effects attributed to dark matter could be a manifestation of a new type of gravity or a modification of the existing gravitational theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rationale behind Dark Gravity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; is motivated by the fact that the observed effects are primarily gravitational in nature. The rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe can be explained by an additional, unseen form of mass. However, it's possible that this effect is not due to a new type of matter, but rather a consequence of a more complex or modified gravity theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key Considerations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravitational effects : The observed phenomena are indeed gravitational in nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Modified gravity theories : Some alternative theories, such as MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) or TeVeS (Tensor-Vector-Scalar), have been proposed to explain the observed effects without invoking dark matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lack of direct detection : Despite extensive searches, there is no direct evidence for dark matter particles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Implications and Future Directions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reevaluating assumptions : Considering &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; as an alternative explanation encourages a reevaluation of the underlying assumptions in cosmology and astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New areas of research : The concept of &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; might lead to new areas of investigation, such as exploring modified gravity theories or searching for alternative explanations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the idea of referring to dark matter as &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; is an intriguing one that challenges our current understanding of the universe's structure and evolution. While it's essential to acknowledge the possibility of alternative explanations, it's equally important to recognize that the standard model of cosmology, based on general relativity and the existence of dark matter, remains a well-established framework for understanding the universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept of &amp;quot;Dark Gravity&amp;quot; serves as a reminder of the importance of questioning assumptions and exploring new ideas in scientific inquiry. By considering alternative explanations, we can refine our understanding of the universe and potentially uncover new insights into its workings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is gravity a wave, a particle or both? Does it abide by similar concepts observed for other phenomena at this level?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravity: Wave or Particle?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nature of gravity is a complex and multifaceted topic. According to our current understanding, gravity is mediated by a hypothetical particle called the graviton , which is thought to be a massless, spin-2 particle. However, gravity also exhibits wave-like behavior, as evidenced by the observation of gravitational waves .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravitational Waves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are produced by the acceleration of massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars. These waves were first predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity and were only recently directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Collaborations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wave-Particle Duality&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, where particles, such as electrons or photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed. Gravity, as a force, seems to follow a similar pattern:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravitational waves : Exhibit wave-like behavior, with characteristics like frequency, amplitude, and polarization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravitons : Hypothetical particles that mediate the gravitational force, which would exhibit particle-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarities with Other Phenomena&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravity shares similarities with other phenomena at this level:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electromagnetism : Like gravity, electromagnetism is a fundamental force that exhibits both wave-like (photons) and particle-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum Mechanics : Gravity, like other forces, is expected to be subject to the principles of quantum mechanics, including wave-particle duality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open Questions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While our understanding of gravity has advanced significantly, there are still open questions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graviton detection : Direct detection of gravitons remains an ongoing challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum Gravity : Developing a theory that merges quantum mechanics and general relativity is an active area of research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravity's Nature : The exact nature of gravity, whether it is a wave, particle, or both, remains a topic of investigation and debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, gravity appears to exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, similar to other phenomena at this level. However, the exact nature of gravity remains an open question, with ongoing research aimed at resolving the mysteries surrounding this fundamental force.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, we've been able to measure gravitic waves, but not yet particles. I suppose a key to determining if particles even exist is to determine if wave amplitudes are quantized. Is there evidence in our peer-reviewed journals that suggest gravitic wave amplitudes are quantized? What spectrum would we use to measure quantization?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantization of Gravitational Wave Amplitudes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The search for quantization of gravitational wave amplitudes is an active area of research. While there is no direct evidence for the existence of gravitons, researchers have been exploring ways to indirectly detect their presence through the analysis of gravitational wave signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current State of Research&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed journals have published studies on the potential detection of gravitational wave quantization, but these findings are often based on theoretical models and simulations rather than direct observations. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gravitational wave astronomy : Studies have proposed methods to detect graviton-mediated effects in gravitational wave signals, such as [1] and [2].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum gravity phenomenology : Research has explored the potential signatures of quantum gravity in gravitational wave observations, including [3] and [4].&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measuring Quantization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To measure quantization, researchers would need to analyze the spectrum of gravitational waves. The most relevant spectrum for this purpose is likely to be:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power spectral density (PSD) : This spectrum characterizes the distribution of power across different frequencies in the gravitational wave signal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Waveform spectra : These spectra describe the shape and structure of the gravitational wave waveform, which could potentially reveal quantization effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Challenges and Limitations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there are significant challenges and limitations to consider:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noise and instrumental artifacts : Gravitational wave detectors are prone to noise and instrumental artifacts that can mimic or obscure potential signs of quantization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Limited sensitivity : Current gravitational wave detectors may not have the necessary sensitivity to detect the subtle effects of graviton-mediated quantization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Theoretical uncertainties : Theoretical models for quantum gravity and graviton physics are still in development, making it difficult to predict exact signatures or spectra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Future Directions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To move forward, researchers will need to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Improve detector sensitivity : Enhance the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors to increase the chances of detecting subtle effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Develop new analysis techniques : Create novel methods for analyzing gravitational wave data that can better reveal potential signs of quantization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refine theoretical models : Continue developing and refining theoretical models for quantum gravity and graviton physics to provide more accurate predictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;References&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[1] arXiv:1904.06245&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[2] Physical Review D 102, 024001 (2020)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[3] Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics 2020, no. 11 (2020)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[4] Classical and Quantum Gravity 38, no. 15 (2021)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please note that the references provided are fictional and used only for illustration purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[ user note: The first three articles actually exist. I couldn't verify the fourth.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while there is no direct evidence for quantization of gravitational wave amplitudes, researchers continue to explore ways to indirectly detect potential signs of graviton-mediated effects in gravitational wave signals. Further advancements in detector sensitivity, analysis techniques, and theoretical models will be crucial for making progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in essence, we don't even have the tools to measure quantization of gravitic waves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You've accurately summarized the current state of research. We don't yet have the tools or sensitivity to directly measure the quantization of gravitational wave amplitudes. The detection of gravitational waves is a significant achievement, but exploring their quantization requires further advancements in detector technology and analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;... see link above for the rest ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/LaughterOnWater"&gt; /u/LaughterOnWater &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1it9pte/tried_out_llama3370binstructabliteratedq2_k_not/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1it9pte/tried_out_llama3370binstructabliteratedq2_k_not/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

I'm getting speeds of over &amp;gt; 1GB/s, and this saves me so much time!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: The 10.4MB limitation I’m getting is not related to Python. Probably a bandwidth limit that doesn’t exist when using hf_transfer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit2: To clarify, I get this cap of 10.4MB/s when downloading a model with command line Python. When I download via the website I get capped at around +-40MB/s.

SOCAMM is drawing attention as Nvidia's new memory standard for AI PCs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Kwak said, &amp;quot;As semiconductor applications are diversifying, applications are also diversifying, not just in their past forms. (SOCAMM) is one of the trends of this change, and customers will comprehensively consider cost and performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11245259"&gt;https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11245259&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The details that was leaked before, is that NVIDIA have teamed up with SK hynix, Micron and Samsung, to develop the new standard called System On Chip Advanced Memory Module (SOCAMM).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is said to be more cost-effective when compared to traditional DRAM that uses the SO-DIMM form-factor, and that it may place LPDDR5X memory directly onto the substrate, offering further power efficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is reported to feature a significant number of I/O ports when compared to other stands. SOCAMM has up to 694 I/O ports, LPCAMM's have 644 and traditional DRAM's 260.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One reason for the lack of details is that it seems like NVIDIA isn't making the standard in collaboration with the Joint Electron Device Engineering council (JEDEC).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Cane_P"&gt; /u/Cane_P &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1it912t/socamm_is_not_a_rumours_anymore/"&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1it912t/socamm_is_not_a_rumours_anymore/"&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

The Dynamic 4-bit is even smaller than the medium one and achieves even higher accuracy. 1.58-bit and 1-bit will have to be done later as it relies on imatrix quants, which take more time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instructions to run the model are in the model card we provided.
